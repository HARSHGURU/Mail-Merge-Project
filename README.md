It enables efficient communication by automating the personalization process, making it easier for you to stay in touch with a large group of individuals while maintaining a personalized touch in your messages.

 Enter the names of the person for which message needs to be generated in a file Input->Nmes->invited_names
 
 The output message file for each person would be saved in Ouput->ReadyToSend
